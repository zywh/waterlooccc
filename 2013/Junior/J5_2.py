# CCC 2013 Junior 5: Chances of Winning

# this is a straight forward, brute force method
# but cleaner than mine :-)
#
# teamcomp is a 2D array. A 1 at position i,j indicates
# that i has NOT YET played j.
#
# For example the original values in teamcomp are:
#     0 1 1 1
#     0 0 1 1
#     0 0 0 1
#     0 0 0 0
#
# and after input of:
#  3
#  4
#  1 3 5 7
#  3 4 8 0
#  2 4 2 2
#  1 2 5 5
#
# then teamcomp would look like:
#     0 0 0 1
#     0 0 1 0
#     0 0 0 0
#     0 0 0 0
#
# Sum would have in it [1,2,6,1] after the above input.
#
# the big nested loops go thru all the games left and
# calculate their new sums.
# Final counts the number of wins for the given team. 
#
