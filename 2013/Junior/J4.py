# CCC 2013 Junior 4: Time on Task

# find the max number of given numbers which sum <= a given total

# read the numbers, sort them and add them up, stopping when the sum > total
# or we hit the end of the numbers
# so if the sum > total the answer is the count - 1
# otherwise its just the count

    count = count + 1
