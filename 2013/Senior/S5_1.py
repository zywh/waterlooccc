# CCC 2013 Senior 5: Factor Solitaire
#
# this is the straight forward, figure out the min cost for each number
# from 1 to the given number.
#
# s5.12.in in about 48sec.
# s5.13.in will be far too slow....
# therfore this "solution" gets 12/15.
#
# It could be improved by finding the prime factorization of each number
# and from those prime factors find all the combos to create all the
# factors, but that's a real pain to do, and it could still be too
# slow.
