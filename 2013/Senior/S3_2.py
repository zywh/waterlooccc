# CCC 2013 Senior 3: Chances of Winning
#
# this version is by Kunal Khamar of Middlefield Collegiate Institute
# 
# there are 6 games: 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, 2-4, 3-4
# (or using 0 thru 3: 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 1-2, 1-3, 2-3)
# each game is either a "W", "L", "T" wrt the 1st team.
# thus each combo of games could be represented as something like "WLLTWT" 
# 
# With no games played, set the original string to "------",
# or after a few games, set it to something like "-W--L-"
# 
# Using that original string create a list of all other possible games, using recursion.
# 
# Count those strings that win for T.


# given a string (s) such as "WLTTLW" and a t determine if
# s results in a winning combo for t (0-3).
