# CCC 2013 Senior 4: Who is Taller?
#
# relatively straight forward Breadth First Search thru a "tree".
#
# Generally speaking The BFS approach is likely better than
# a Depth First Search that a recursive approach would take. 
# Going deep, could lead to a stack overflow, while the BFS
# approach avoids that. Also in this case the BFS is very easy 
# to implement.
