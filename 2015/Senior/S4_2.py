# CCC 2015 Senoir 4: Convex Hull
#
# written by Daniel Whitney, Newmarket High School
#
# NOTE: This is in python 3, tho I believe it would take very little
#       to convert it to python 2 (switch range to xrange, print() to
#       print).
#
# This problem being a shortest path problem, I used Dijkstra's algorithm
# with some modifications to find it.
# Read:
#    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm#Algorithm
# for a quick description of how the basic algorithm works.
#
# From now on I am going to assume you know how Dijkstra's algorithm works
# so I can explain the modifications.
#
# First we have to recognize instead of simply storing the minimum
# distance to each island, we are going to have to store the minimum
# distance with X (X is 1 to 200) hull remaining to each point.  And when
# we would add a point to the que that has a negative or zero hull value,
# we simply skip it.  Thes additional states simply add more nodes to the
# graph, but when we're checking for the endpoint we check only to see if
# the current island is the correct ending island.  In this case the first
# time the ending island is removed from the que, we know we've found the
# smallest distance.
#
# For implementing the binary trees, refer to:
#    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap#Heap_operations
#
# I found this page explained them fairly thoroughly.
