# CCC 2015 Senior 2: Jerseys
#
# The problem is simple.
# 1. store the jersy sizes. (no tricks required)
# 2. read reach request: if its a small -> satisfied
#                        if sizes match -> satisfied
#                        if its a M request for a L -> satisfied
#                        Once a jersy has been given out, mark it as "T" (taken)
#
# With some tweaking of the file input and converting a string to an integer using
# int(s,10) I was able to get the time for the last data set under 4 seconds 
# with my old machine (XP Pentium 4 CPU, 3.2Ghz, 1G RAM).
