# CCC 2015 Junior 4: Wait Time
#
# Consider this a 2D array problem, or an array of records
#
# For this I use and array of elements called "database"
# Each element is itself an array of 3 numbers: 
#     the friend #, time of message, and the total wait time for this friend
#
# I need it organized like this so it can be sorted by friend number at the end.
#
# Also the time of message will be set to -1 when answered, 
# so at the end I can detect if there are unanswered messages.
#
# eg [12,6,2] means friend 12 has made a call at time 6 (its not replied to so far)
#             and he/she has a wait time of 2 from previous message(s)

                                   # the -1 is there because +1 will be added next time
    else:
        time = time + 1

# A simple bubble sort is used
