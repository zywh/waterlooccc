// This is Dynamic Programming approach
//
// Four people, independently, sent me this same algorithm
// Konstantin Lopyrev, Amlesh Jayakumar, Matthew Lai and one other. 
// This is Konstantin's version.
//
// The idea is to have a 4D array representing all
// possible positions, and determine if they are winning
// positions or not. This is created first. Then when  
// a starting position is read, you can just look up the
// answer. 
//
// The array is called winningPosition and is filled with 
// false to begin with. 
// SO, (and this is key.) 
//       We assume all positions are loosing ones.
// (that's the first set of loops in main)
//
// All that remains to to find the winning ones. 
// and that's easy:
//       a winning Position is one which has a move
//                        which leads to a loosingPosition.
// (that's the second set of loops in the main)
//
// That's it, except for the method loosingPosition.
// This method was tough to wrap my head around.
// "A loosing position is one which is NOT a winning one." 
// (and by the way, if the given position is an impossible position
// its not a loosing position.) 
//
// The problem I have with this is: I'm trying to determine the value
// of winningPosition, which calls the loosingPosition method
// and it uses winningPosition to determine that...
// That's circular reasoning!!! But its not.   
// As in all DP methods, we work from the ground up so to speak. 
// 
// Look at it another way. The lowest positions like 0,0,0,0 are 
// loosingPositions, Because if you apply any rule to it, it gives
// negatives and the loosingPosition method for that will return false and 
// the value of winningPosition[0][0][0][0] retains unchanged, at false.
// So the "can't move" positions are essentially taken care of with
// the if in loosingPosition() and the initial assumption
// that all positions are loosing ones. 
//
// Later on as you move up to a bigger position, that has moves to be made,
// if you are looking at some move a,b,c,d then the call to loosingPosition
// will involve SMALLER values, (a lower position), that is, one that
// we already figured out, for sure, is a winning or loosing position,
// so we CAN reliably return a value that we can use to establish what
// the original a,b,c,d is. QED.
//
// if that still doesn't make sense, sorry.  I tried :-)
// (This DOES work!)
