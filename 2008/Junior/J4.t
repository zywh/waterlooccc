% J4: Prefix to postfix
%
% It occurs to me that the best way to do this
% is with recursion.
%
% this method takes an input prefix string s, 
% and creates the postfix, stored in post1
% with a temporary string called rest
%
% generally the method is, if the postfix starts with + or -
% the first operand starts in the third letter
% the second operand is found from the rest of the string
%     (after the first operand is taken out)
% then put the postfix together: "first second +"
%
% If the postfix starts with a number, that is the postfix. 
%
% an example might help, starting with "+ - 1 2 3"
% 1. it would enter with s = "+ - 1 2 3"
% 2. it would enter again with s = "- 1 2 3"
% 3. it would enter again with "1 2 3" and leave with post1="1" and rest="2 3"
%          (the "1" is the first part of "- 1 2 3")
% 4. it would enter again with "2 3" and leave with post1="2" and rest="3"
%          (the "2" is the second part of "- 1 2 3")
%    now 2 finishes with post1 = "1 2 -" and rest = "3"
%    now the first half of 1 is done and second call is done:
% 5. it would enter with s = "3" and leave with post1 = "3" and rest = ""
% now 1 is done with post1 = "1 2 - 3 +"
%
% think about it enough and you'll get it :-)
