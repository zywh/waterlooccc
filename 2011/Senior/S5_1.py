# CCC 2011 Senior 5: Switch
# written by C. Robart
# March 2011

# this is a string exercise. Starting from either end find the
# smaller group of 1's. Then turn on a single light next to that group
# on the side closest to the centre. If groups of 4 or more are
# created, switch them off. Repeat. Done. 


# do the switch, turn all groups of 7,6,5 or 4 lights off.
# (can't be 8 on together as no group of 4 exists by itself)
def switchOff(x):
    x = x.replace ("1111111","0000000")
    x = x.replace ("111111","000000")
    x = x.replace ("11111","00000")
    x = x.replace ("1111","0000")
    return x

# returns true if there are no lights on
def done(x):
    return x.find("1") < 0


# this will turn on one light
# working from the ends, it finds the first/last group of lights
# it then turns on a light next to the smallest of these two groups,
# towards the centre.
#
# a group, coming from the left, looks like "10"
# then count the 1's previous to this.
#
# a group, coming from the right, looks like "01"
# then count the 1's previous to this.
#
# comparing the two above, turn on the light, towards the centre.
