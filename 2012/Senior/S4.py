# S4 2012: A Coin Game
#
# this is a brute force, Breadth First Search
# of the game tree.
#
# Version 4: a move, or state is an array (of strings)
#
# This is version is due to help and insights of
# Daniel Hui, Amlesh Jayakumar, Daniel Cressman and Kevin Luo.
#
# The idea is that there will be LOTS of moves stored in the
# game tree and before you can add a new one, you have to
# determine if it's already in the tree. 
# Doing a search thru the tree takes too long.
#
# So consider the arrangement "35/4/_/2/1"
# That could be thought of as 43010 (in base 5)
# because the 1 is in position 4, 2 in 3,
# 3 in 0, 4 in 1 and the the 5 in position 0 as well.
#
# Now take that number, 43010 and convert it to base 10
# using this method: 4*5^0 + 3*5^1 + 0*5^2 + 1*5^3 + 0*5^4
# = 144.
#
# Now use that number as the index to a visited array.
# Visited is started as all False. As we generate moves,
# the visited array (for that number/move) is set to True
# and we don't "visit" it again.
#
# the size of visited is n^n because the "worst case" is
# "_/_/_/_/12345" which translates to 44444 (in base 5)
# which is one less than 100000 (base 5) or 5^5 base 10.
#
# Further refinements to this coade have been suggested,
# 1. in done(), use the number, not the array of strings
# and check if it is the equivalent of 01234 (base 5)
# (my testing of that only improved the last data set
#  by less than 2 sec)
# 2. store the number, not the string array in the tree
# and then convert the number back to a string array to
# generate the next move. I didn't bother as that seemed
# a lot of work and this IS working already.
#
# THIS WORKS!
