# S3 2012: Absolutely Acidic

# For the largest files this takes about 45sec.
# All that is spent reading. The sort takes
# less than 1 second. 
#
# The algorithm is very straight forward;
#  read the file and count the readings and store in a list of 1..1000
#  sort the list descending (sub sorting helps case 1)
#  max and second max are at the first so determine the case
#  and calculate the answer.
