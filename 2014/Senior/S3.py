# CCC Senior 3: the Geneva Confection

# A Stack problem

# Test case 5 runs on my machine in 4 seconds :-)
# (a Pentium 4, 3.2 Ghz, 1GB RAM)
#
# I fine tuned the file input to shave off a second or 2.
# (File input seems to be the slowest part.)
#
# For the cars on the mountain, I just use an index (mtnCar)
# to keep track of where I am.
# (Nothing actually is removed from it.)
#
# For the branch, I use a list and literally add to or
# pop from it. (You can't just keep track of where you are,
# because sometimes things have to 'come off' literally.)
