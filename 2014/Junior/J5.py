# Array inverse checking (The idea is for all positions i
# in array A, find the position of B[i] in A, call it j.
# Now A[i] should equal B[j].)
#
# The problem is made easy because the input lines
# are guaranteed to have N DIFFERENT names, so no checks
# for duplicates or missing names need occur and the second
# line has the SAME names as the first, so no checks needed
# for 'not found' conditions.

file = open ("j5.5b.in", "r")
n = int(file.readline())

first = file.readline().split()
second = file.readline().split()

# for each position i, it must be the case that
# first [i] = second[position in first of second[i]]
# (ie. a to b is also b to a)
# and that position in first of second[i] not = i
# (ie. a to a is not the case)
