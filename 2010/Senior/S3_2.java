// S3 2010 V3: Firehose
//
// version 3: arrays, sorting and binary search
//            (works for all)
// version 2: linked lists: start with h hydrants
//            combining the closest two to eliminate one
//            until K reached (worked for 1 to 5)
// version 1: arrays: eliminate the k biggest gaps.
//            (worked for the first couple of data sets)
//
//
// okay, so this uses the following idea. 
// If you'll need a max hose length of say 200, 
// then lets use a 200 hose length EVERYWHERE!
//
// The hose length is a radius. I use a diameter instead
// and to find the correct length hose, I try diameters
// in a binary search fashion to get to the correct length quickly. 
// Before starting on the process I simplify things by sorting
// and shifting the houses so the biggest gap between houses comes 
// after the LAST house. Thus there are no "wrap around" 
// circular issues.
//
// For a given diameter, I start with the first house and see
// which other houses fall within the diameter. That's one. 
// Then I start at the next house, not covered and cover it
// and the next ones till I can't cover any more. That's two.
// Eventually I get to the last house and look at my count.
// If the count is k, I'm done. (almost)
// To be "double sure" I then reduce the diamter by 1 until
// my count goes above k. Then (diameter+1)/2 is the answer. 
//
// This took me 1 solid week of study of the TEST data. 
// One of the toughest problems I've seen so far!  :-)
