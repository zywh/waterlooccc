// CCC 2009

// S5: Wireless
//
// Straight forward approach:
// 1. Input the main dimensions of the city
// 2. for each wirelsss station read, add the
//    bit rate to the coffeshops within the circle
// 3. find the max bitrate coffeshop and print
// 4. count the max bitrates and print
//
// I abandoned this approach for nearly a week trying to 
// think of some clever DP method, or anything else
// that would not involve traversing the array multiple times. 
//
// Eventually I gave up trying to think of something else
// and re focused my efforts at improving the efficiency
// of this straight forward approach.
//
// Here are all my tricks:
// 1. Because java stores arrays row-wise, I turned the city 
//    on its side and make each row 30,000 wide, not 1000.
//    (1000 rows of 30,000 can be traversed faster than the reverse)
// 2. I tightend up the code so that few calculations are
//    done in the inner loop, by usig extra variables
// 3. I process the centre row first and work outward in either 
//    direction. Not sure if it matters much, but I did it.
// 4. Instead of doing x and checking if I'm done, 30,000 times
//    in the inner loop, I do ten things before checking if I'm done yet.
//    This could be increased to prehaps 50 or 100 or more. 
//    (copy and paste is cheap). This was quite a time saver. 
//
// these got 1,2,3 and 6 data sets well within time limits. 
// Sets 4 and 5 still stayed stubbornly at 2:30 sec (approx). 
// The final "Ah Ah" was (after extensive cheating and looking at
// the real data)
//
// 5. Look for and elimitate all the BIG circles. 
//    The idea is that if a station broadcasts to the entire city 
//    it have NO effect on finding the max place. So I simply
//    add up the bitrate for the big stations and add it to the 
//    max at the end. (Who would have guessed there would be lots 
//    of such stations?)
//    BTW a big station has a radius + the long coordinte > 30033
//    provided the radius > the long coordinate. 30033 comes from
//    the fact the worse case is if the station is in the centre at
//    15,000 on one edge. To cover the far corner it takes a radius
//    of 15033. 
//
// that concludes the HARDEST program yet in the CCC because without
// having access to the final test data, why bother going to
// the lengths necessary to tweek a WORKING PROGRAM 
// sufficiently to get in under the wire?
