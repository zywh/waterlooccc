//
// For the first question this is TRICKY. Shame on the CCC. :-(
//
// The trick is you can't just try all the numbers from a to b
// to see if they are perfect squares and cubes. ITS TOO SLOW!!!
//
// You need to walk thru the cubes, between a and b, checking
// if any are perfect squares as well. 
// (To do that find the cuberoot of a and walk thru the main loop
// incrementing the cuberoot by 1 until the cube exceeds b.)
