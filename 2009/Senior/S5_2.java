// S5: Wireless   V2     The better version :-)
//
// This algorithm is by Brian Bi of Woburn Collegiate Institute
//
// Amlesh Jayakumar and Daniel Galperin of Waterloo Collegiate Institute
// also came up with the same idea.
//  
// Here is the idea.
//
// Suppose you have an array x with values:
//      6 3 9 12 13 5 3
// stored in locations 0 to 6
//
// There is an alternate way to store these values: AS DIFFERENCES
// For example the above could be stored as
//      6 -3 6 3 1 -8 -2
// the idea is that element 0 is the normal value
// but for all the rest, the ith value is x[i] - x[i-1]
//
// Why do this? Because its very easy to add a value to
// a subset of the array with ONLY 2 assignments! 
//
// For example in the above, suppose we wanted to add 4 to the values
// of x from element 2 to 5. All we have to do is ADD 4 to element 2
// AND SUBTRACT 4 from element 6. Getting
//      6 -3 10 3 1 -8 -6
//
// To see that this is correct, expand it back out:
//      6 3 13 16 17 9 3
// TA DA! (4 was added to elements 2 thru 5)
//
// So in a sense this method works like my original solution, BUT mine
// took FOREVER to add the bitrate to ALL the values, this improves things 
// HUGE by just adding (or subtracting) the bitrate at the ends.
//
// Amlesh and Daniel described this method as adding the bitrate to the 
// left side of the cirle and subtracting the bitrate from the right side. 
// Exactly the same thing. 
//
